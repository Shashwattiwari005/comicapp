"**The Thirsty Crow**

In a small forest, a crow named Kala was perched on a branch of a tall tree, her feathers ruffled by the gentle breeze. She had been flying for hours, searching for a drink of water to quench her parched throat. The sun beat down on her, and her beak felt cracked and dry.

As she scanned the landscape below, Kala spotted a few birds splashing in a small pond. Her eyes grew wider with hope, and she took to the skies once more. Darting downwards, she landed on the muddy edge of the pond, her thirst momentarily forgotten in her excitement.

But, alas, the pond was filled with stones, and not a single drop of water was visible. Undeterred, Kala surveyed the surroundings, her keen eyes spotting a patch of shiny pebbles scattered on the ground. She watched as a human child, playing nearby, carefully placed one of the pebbles into the pond.

As the pebble sank into the depths, water began to bubble up from the ground, and Kala's eyes sparkled with joy. She dipped her beak into the cool liquid, feeling it soothe her dry, cracked tongue. Ah, this was ambrosia!

Over the next few days, Kala returned to the pond, using the pebbles to clear the water and drink her fill. But she didn't forget to repay the favor. Each day, she would perch nearby, watching the child play, and occasionally, she would swoop down to retrieve a stray pebble and place it back in the pond.

As time passed, the child grew curious about the clever crow's visits. One day, the youngster carefully placed a small bowl on the ground, filled with a few pebbles and a tiny trench leading to the pond. The crow, sensing a new game, began to drop the pebbles into the trench, creating a miniature flood that brought forth more water.

The child squealed with delight, and Kala, pleased with herself, settled nearby, her feathers glistening in the warm sunlight. From that day on, the two became the best of friends, playing a game of "Pebble Poker" that would last for many summers to come.

As Kala flew away, her belly full and her thirst quenched, she couldn't help but think that sometimes, all it takes is a little creativity, a bit of persistence, and a willingness to give back to create a friendship that will last a lifetime."
